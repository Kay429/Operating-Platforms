# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room wanted to move their game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android application to a web based platform that is compatible with more than one operating 
	system.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - I think I did well analyzing the UML diagram and was also very happy with some of my responses in the recommendations section. 
  (Assuming I understood the questions correctly.) 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - It helped me to think about the code on multiple levels and to consider multiple issues that need to be solved before coding begins. 
  It is difficult for me to create algorithms because there are a lot of elements to figure out, but the design document helps to address those elements individually
  so that everything can come together more smoothly.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - I would revise the chart in the Evaluation section. I feel it could have been better presented, so I would improve it by organizing the information 
  to be clearer and to flow better.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - Because Draw It or Lose It is a game, a very important aspect of the user experience is performance. I did my best to come up with ideas that
  keep the application running quickly and cater to the needs of as many users as possible. I also tried to make sure the design kept user security in mind
  by only taking necessary user information and keeping it encrypted, as well as ensuring users create strong passwords. The user's needs are important 
  because they are the customers of the client, and they will not play the game if it does not perform well. It is important to make sure user information 
  is secure because it is the responsibility of a company that requests personal information to keep it safe from unauthorized access.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - I tried to consider the needs of the client as well as the users when making my recommendations. In the future, I think I could improve my designs by 
  coming up with multiple solutions and determining which one is the best, because the greatest ideas often come after a bit of brainstorming.
